## Introduction
Swadeshi Sahayak AI is an open-source project developed by Tejas Shirnalkar. It serves as a demonstration of a multilingual AI assistant tailored to empower India's Generation X, rather than being a practical problem-solving tool for them.

## Project Mission
Swadeshi Sahayak AI strives to make technology more accessible and relevant to Generation X. We believe that by creating a seamless interface between AI and real-life challenges, we can empower this generation to embrace and harness the potential of AI, enabling them to navigate the digital age with confidence and ease.
